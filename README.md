Based on the initial analysis of the Python script, it appears that this is a command-line-based warehouse management system for a vegan product shop. The software allows the user to perform various operations such as adding products to the warehouse, listing products, recording sales, and checking profits.

I will draft a README file based on this functionality.

# Warehouse Management Software

## Introduction

This project is a command-line-based software designed for the management of a warehouse, particularly for a vegan product store. The software enables users to manage stock, record sales, and calculate profits using simple terminal commands. It is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate basic inventory and sales tracking without a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **Add products**: Add new products to the warehouse inventory.
- **List products**: View the current products in stock.
- **Record sales**: Register sales transactions and update stock accordingly.
- **View profits**: Display total profits from sales.
- **Command-line interface**: Simple and lightweight, no GUI required.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/warehouse-management-software.git
    cd warehouse-management-software
    ```

2. **Ensure Python is installed** (version 3.6+ recommended). You can verify Python's installation by running:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

3. **Run the software**:
    ```bash
    python Software_negozio_prodotti_vegani_FG.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the program is started, you can interact with it via the following commands:

- `aggiungi`: Add a product to the warehouse.
- `elenca`: List all products in the warehouse.
- `vendita`: Record a sale.
- `profitti`: View total profits.
- `aiuto`: Display available commands.
- `chiudi`: Exit the program.

### Example Usage

- **Adding a product**:
    ```
    Comando: aggiungi
    Nome: tofu
    Quantità: 10
    Prezzo: 5.50
    ```

- **Listing products**:
    ```
    Comando: elenca
    ```

- **Recording a sale**:
    ```
    Comando: vendita
    Nome: tofu
    Quantità venduta: 2
    ```

- **Viewing profits**:
    ```
    Comando: profitti
    ```

## Dependencies

This software requires the following Python libraries:
- `json` (for handling data storage)
- `os` (for interacting with the operating system)

Both of these libraries are part of Python's standard library, so no external dependencies are needed.

## Configuration

The software does not require any special configuration. All data is saved locally using JSON files for simplicity.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ensure Python is installed**: If you encounter issues running the script, ensure that Python is properly installed and available in your system's PATH.
- **Command errors**: If the program does not recognize a command, use the `aiuto` command to view all available commands.
